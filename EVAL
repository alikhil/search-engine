THE COMPUTERISED LIBRARY AS A WORKING MILIEU. NO DANISH LIBRARY IS YET FULLY COMPUTERISED, THOUGH INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS ARE IN OPERATION. SPECIALISED EDUCATION, ESPECIALLY IN-SERVICE COURSES, IS NECESSARY, BUT LIBRARIANS' COMPLAINTS ABOUT COMPUTERISATION MAY STEM FROM SEVERAL PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS NOT YET FULLY EXPLORED. STAFF MAY FEEL RULED BY THE MACHINE UNLESS ENCOURAGED TO UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM THOROUGHLY AND TAKE PART IN ORGANISING WORK PROCESSES. IN SETTING UP SAMKAT AT THE DANISH NATIONAL LIBRARY, CATALOGUERS HAVE BEEN FULLY INVOLVED IN THE 1ST (CATALOGUING) STAGE, AND WILL TAKE PART IN FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEM TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY. WHEN STAFF FEEL AT EASE WITH THE COMPUTER, ITS ADVANTAGES INCLUDE MAKING THEIR WORK LESS STRENUOUS BUT MORE STIMULATING (PROVIDED GOOD-QUALITY PRINT-OUTS ARE ATTAINED) AND IMPROVING INTER-LIBRARY COOPERATION AND SERVICE TO READERS. LIBRARIANS SHOULD REMAIN RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR WORKING CONDITIONS, AND INTRODUCE TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPME NTS AT A SUITABLE TEMPO.

USE STATISTICS: A PLANETARY VIEW. HISTORICAL STATISTICS FROM THE AUTOMATED CIRCULATION SYSTEM WERE PROFILED AGAINST TOTAL BOOK HOLDINGS AT THE NASA GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER LIBRARY TO REVEAL INTEREST PATTERNS AND RECENT CHANGES IN USE. THESE STATISTICAL RATIOS WERE ANALYSED AS A CRITICAL INCREMENT OF AN OVERALL LIBRARY EVALUATION STUDY TO DETERMINE THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE LIBRARY MET AND ANTICIPATED NEEDS. THE ANALYSIS RESULTED IN THE STRENGTHENING OF CERTAIN AREAS; IT INITIATED AN AUTOMATED CHANGE DETECTION MECHANISM, AND IT ACCELERATED THE DECISION TO STORE USE HISTORY IN THE MACHINE READABLE SHELFLIST RECORD AS A MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM DATA ELEMENT.

AUTOMATED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS WITH DIRECT ACCESS TO INFORMATION. (FOREIGN PRESS MATERIALS). DISCUSSES BRIEFLY THE PRINCIPLES OF ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS AND POINTS OUT THAT ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL IS 5 TO 10 TIMES FASTER THAN MANUAL RETRIEVAL. LISTS THE DISADVANTAGES OF ON-LINE INFORMATION SYSTEMS: THE BUILDING OF DATA BASES IS A COMPLEX TASK; DUPLICATION OF INFORMATION IS UNAVOIDABLE; THE COSTS ARE HIGH AND STAFF MUST BE TRAINED TO USE THESE SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, STAFF MUST LEARN A NUMBER OF 'COMMAND LANGUAGES' BECAUSE OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF ON-LINE SYSTEMS AVAILABLE. THIS PROBLEM COULD PERHAPS BE OVERCOME BY USING 'TRANSPARENT SYSTEMS' WHICH FUNCTION AS AN INTERFACE, OR 'A TRANSLATOR', BETWEEN THE SEARCHER AND THE MACHINE. IN THIS CASE THE SEARCHER WOULD ONLY NEED ONE COMMAND LANGUAGE.

Relevant

INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY: SUBSTITUTE OR SUPPORT FOR THE HUMAN COMPONENTS?. DISCUSSION ABOUT OR APPLICATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY IS HINDERED BY PEOPLE'S ATTITUDES TO IT, RANGING FROM THE OVER-ENTHUSIASTIC TO THE PROFOUNDLY SUSPICIOUS. MEN SEEM TO HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY COMPUTERS, SO THE HUMAN FACTOR IN TECHNOLOGY IS NEGLECTED. DATA BASES MUST, HOWEVER, BE ORIENTED TOWARDS MAN'S NEEDS, AND DIALOGUE SYSTEMS ARE MEANT FOR MACHINES AND MEN; HUMAN INTERMEDIARIES BETWEEN MACHINES AND USERS WILL BE NEEDED FOR A LONG TIME. ALL SCIENTISTS SEARCH THEIR OWN STOCK OF INFORMATION BEFORE USING OTHER SOURCES; AT PRESENT THERE IS NO CONNECTION BETWEEN OR ANALYSIS OF THESE SMALL, INFORMAL STOCKS. CONNECTION OF LARGE RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS WITH INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS WOULD SHOW RESPECT FOR THE HUMAN COMPONENTS. THE INFORMAL HUMAN EXCHANGE OF OPINION AND THE HUMAN BRAIN'S ABILITY TO CREATE CROSS-CONNECTIONS IN INFORMATION ARE STILL ESSENTIAL.

Irrelevant

LIBRARIES AND COMPUTERS. THE DEBATE ON COMPUTERS IN LIBRARIES CENTRES AROUND 2 QUESTIONS' WHETHER COMPUTERS ON THE WHOLE ARE OF BENEFIT TO USERS, AND WHETHER THE BUMS SYSTEM IN PARTICULAR IS OF VALUE. INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTERS MEANS THAT LIBRARY STAFF BECOME DEPENDENT ON EXPERTS. AS PROCESSES BECOME AUTOMATED THEY ALSO BECOME DEHUMANISED, AND READERS USE MACHINES DIRECTLY WITH MINIMAL HELP FROM STAFF. SOME SKILLS ARE LOST AND REPLACED WITH ROUTINES. AS FOR THE BUMS SYSTEM, SOME ROUTINES HAVE MERELY REPLACED OTHERS. A TRADITIONAL CARD CATALOGUE IS EASIER TO USE THAN THE BUMS CATALOGUE, ALTHOUGH THE LATTER MAKES SURVEY OF THE LIBRARY'S TOTAL STOCK POSSIBLE. BUT THIS LEADS IN TURN TO INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF REQUESTS WITHIN THE LIBRARY SYSTEM; IT FAVOURS THE ACTIVE, EXPERIENCED USERS, BUT DISCOURAGES THE INEXPERIENCED AND THE BROWSERS. THE COST OF GATHERING OF STATISTICS THROUGH THROUGH BUMS AND TRAINING OF STAFF IN DATA TECHNOLOGY MUST BE SET AGAINST OTHER POSSIBLE USES OF THE RESOURCES.

THE ETHICS OF FURTHER EDUCATION LIBRARIANSHIP. THE LIBRARIAN'S 'CLIENTS' IN THE FURTHER EDUCATION SECTOR ARE IDENTIFIED. HIS DUTIES TOWARDS THEM AND THE PROBLEMS RAISED BY THEM ARE DISCUSSED, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE EDUCATION OF THE 16-19 AGE GROUP. THE NEED FOR THE LIBRARIAN TO HOLD THEIR DIVERSE AND SOMETIMES CONFLICTING DEMANDS IN BALANCE IS SEEN AS AN ASPECT OF HIS DUTIES THAT REQUIRES PROFESSIONAL AUTONOMY FOR ITS SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE. THE NEED FOR A BALANCED USE OF THE FACILITIES, COVERAGE OF SUBJECT AREAS, PROVISION FOR DIVERGENT VIEWS, AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF FREE ENQUIRY LEADS TO THE SUGGESTION THAT TREATMENT RATHER THAN IDEAS IS WHAT THE LIBRARIAN IS BEST QUALIFIED TO ASSESS. PORNOGRAPHY IS DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO THIS AND OTHER CRITERIA. THE GROWTH OF OPEN LEARNING IS SEEN AS DEMANDING A POSITIVE TUTORIAL APPROACH. THE NEED FOR MORAL COURAGE IS AFFIRMED.

THE ROLE OF TECHNICAL AND SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION IN THE TRAINING OF USERS. IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA IN 1952 A DECREE WAS PASSED ON THE EXTENSION TRAINING OF PHYSICIANS AND PHARMACISTS. IT IS THE TASK OF THE BRATISLAVA INSTITUTE OF EXTENSION TRAINING FOR PHYSICIANS AND PHARMACISTS TO SUPPLY LITERATURE AND INFORMATION FOR THIS EXTENSION TRAINING. THIS MEANS THE INFORMATION SUPPLY OF MORE THAN 53 LEARNING GROUPS; ABOUT 2,500 PHYSICIANS AND PHARMACISTS A YEAR. LITERATURE IS AVAILABLE FOR IN-LIBRARY READING, A LARGE NUMBER OF DOCUMENTS ARE LENT (30,000 UNITS A YEAR). IT IS, HOWEVER, CONSIDERED MORE IMPORTANT TO TEACH THE PARTICIPANTS OF EXTENSION TRAINING HOW TO USE THE LITERATURE AND INFORMATION TOOLS THEMSELVES (INCLUDING ABSTRACTING JOURNALS, INDEXES AND MAGNETIC TAPES).

OCLC-AN AMERICAN INFORMATION SYSTEM ON ITS WAY TO DENMARK. LIBRARY AUTOMATION BEGAN IN 1965 WITH THE FIRST MARC PILOT PROJECT INITIATED BY THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS AND SOON TAKEN UP BY THE BRITISH NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY. INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS HAVE BEEN DRAWN UP TO SECURE WORLDWIDE USE OF THE SYSTEM, CULMINATING IN THE ATTEMPT TO CREATE UNIVERSAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL. HOWEVER, EXCHANGE OF INTERNATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA HAS BEEN BESET BY PROBLEMS, SO THAT INTERNATIONAL USE OF MACHINE READABLE INFORMATION IS NOT VERY WIDESPREAD. THE USE OF INTERNATIONAL, ENGLISH LANGUAGE BASED STANDARDS AND EXCHANGE OF ACTUAL TAPE HAVE CAUSED PROBLEMS IN SCANDINAVIA. FOR THESE REASONS BIBLIOGRAPHIC SERVICE CENTRES, 'UTILITIES', HAVE BEEN SET UP IN USA AND ENGLAND, AN IDEA WHICH IS ALSO BEHIND THE DANISH SYSTEMS SAMKAT AND BIBLIOTEKSDATA. THE LARGEST IS THE US OCLC, WHICH BEGAN IN 1967. ITS MAIN TASK IS DEVELOPMENT OF A BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASE AND DECENTRALISED CATALOGUING, WHICH SUPPLIES THE BASE WITH 60, 000 TITLES ANNUALLY FROM 4,000 TERMINALS. IT ALSO OPERATES AN INTERLENDING SYSTEM, AND HOPES TO ADD ACCESSIONS AND ISSUE CONTROL SYSTEMS TO THE SERVICES. THE MAIN PRODUCT IS CATALOGUE CARDS. WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF 'OCLC EUROPE', DANISH LIBRARIES WILL HAVE TO TAKE A STAND FOR OR AGAINST COOPERATION WITH IT.

AN ASSOCIATIVE FILE STORE USING FRAGMENTS FOR RUN-TIME INDEXING AND COMPRESSION. AN ASSOCIATIVE FILE STORE (AFS) IS OFFERED AS A SIMPLE SOLUTION TO CURRENT PROBLEMS WITH ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. IT WOULD BE A SINGLE-INSTRUCTION MULTIPLE-DATA STREAM MACHINE, DEDICATED TO ASSOCIATIVE FILE SEARCHING WHILE OVERALL CONTROL OF THE SYSTEM WOULD BE ENTRUSTED TO A CONVENTIONAL SINGLE-INSTRUCTION SINGLE-DATA STREAM MACHINE. THE ASSOCIATIVE PARALLEL PROCESSOR (A MAJOR COMPONENT OF AFS) WOULD SUPPORT 'ON-THE-FLY' FILE SEARCHING AND SIMPLIFY THE INDEXING PROBLEMS OF DIRECTLY ACCESSING SINGLE RECORDS TO THAT OF INDICATING THE MOST PROBABLE SCAN BLOCK FOR A HIGH RECALL OF MATCHING RECORDS. INITIAL CONSIDERATIONS SUGGEST THAT AFS WOULD OUT-PERFORM CONVENTIONAL FILE STORES BY OVER 2 ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE, BE SIMPLE TO MAINTAIN, AND OFFER FULL FREE-TEXT RETRIEVAL FLEXIBILITY.

LIBRARIES AND EDUCATIONAL BROADCASTING. CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO EDUCATIONAL BROADCASTING AND LIBRARIES. DESCRIBES THE LINKS BETWEEN RENFREW DISTRICT LIBRARIES AND THE BBC ADULT LITERACY PROJECT. IN 1975, THE SCOTTISH ADULT LITERACY AGENCY AWARDED THE LIBRARIES A *6500 GRANT TO PROVIDE ADULT LITERACY MATERIALS, AND BBC PROMOTION MATERIALS WERE USED TO EXTEND THE LIBRARY'S SERVICES. THE BBC SHOWED GREAT ENTHUSIASM FOR THE PROJECT AND SELECTED PAISLEY AS A VENUE FOR THE ROADSHOW PROGRAMME-A SUCCESSFUL VENTURE, ALTHOUGH IT OVERSIMPLIFIED THE SERVICES AND INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE LIBRARIES. LIBRARIES MUST RESPOND TO THE INTEREST GENERATED BY THE MEDIA, BY PROVIDING RESOURCES, STUDY FACILITIES, AND PROFESSIONAL SKILLS REQUIRED OF LIBRARIANS BY INDIVIDUALS IN AN OPEN LEARNING SITUATION.

THE USE OF AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING IN LIBRARIES' IDEAS FOR A NEW VIEWPOINT. ALTHOUGH LIBRARIANS FORMERLY ADOPTED A DEFENSIVE ATTITUDE WHEN INTRODUCING AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING, ITS USE RESULTED IN ERGONOMIC IMPROVEMENTS AND MORE INTERESTING WORK FOR SOME STAFF. THE USE OF AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING CAN, HOWEVER, CAUSE STRESS AND MONOTONY, THE CONTROL OF WORK AND HUMAN POTENTIAL BY MACHINES, INCREASED ISOLATION OF INDIVIDUALS, THE DOWNGRADING OF SOME LIBRARY POSTS AND THE LOSS OF A FRIENDLY ATMOSPHERE FOR READERS. IF THE HUMAN TOUCH IS TO BE RETAINED IN LIBRARIES, NEW STANDARDS ARE REQUIRED. GOOD COMMUNICATION MUST BE DEVELOPED BETWEEN STAFF MEMBERS AND BETWEEN STAFF AND READERS. STAFF WORK MUST BE REORGANISED AND THE TENDENCY TO GIGANTISM IN THE USE OF AUTOMATION AVOIDED.

MANY OF THESE LANGUAGES BEAR RELATIONSHIPS TO ONE ANOTHER, BY VIRTUE OF COMMON ANCESTRY, COMMON DESIGN PHILOSOPHY, ETC. EVEN SO, THE SAME LANGUAGE CAN BE IMPLEMENTED DIFFERENTLY BY 2 SUPPLIERS. DIFFERENT IMPLEMENTATIONS AND/OR LANGUAGES MUST BE CONSIDERED BY ON-LINE USERS BEFORE CONTRACTING WITH A HOST. THE CONSEQUENCES OF LEARNING A NEW COMMAND SET, BUYING ADDITIONAL MANUALS, AND ATTENDING EXTRA COURSES ARE ALL ECONOMIC ONES, AND ARE PARTICULARLY RELEVANT WHEN A DATA BASE IS OFFERED BY SEVERAL SUPPLIERS.

PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND LITERACY AMONGST CHILDREN AND ADULTS. IN THE NETHERLANDS DESPITE COMPULSORY EDUCATION FOR THE WHOLE POPULATION THERE ARE NOW SOME 100,000 TO 400,000 (SEMI-)ILLITERATES. IN DUTCH SCHOOLS 2 METHODS OF LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE HAVE BEEN USED, THE TRADITIONAL METHOD OF LEARNING TO RECOGNISE LISTS OF SIMPLE BUT UNRELATED WORDS AND THE FUNCTIONAL METHOD WHICH WAS RELATED TO THE PUPIL'S ENVIRONMENT AND EXPERIENCE. WHICHEVER METHOD IS USED, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO DEVELOP THE PUPIL'S ABILITY TO READ FLUENTLY AND TO MOTIVATE HIM TO CONTINUE READING AFTER LEAVING SCHOOL. THE DUTCH PUBLIC LIBRARY ACT OF 1975 RECOGNISED THE IMPORTANCE OF LIBRARY SERVICES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN ABOLISHING LIBRARY MEMBERSHIP CHARGES UP TO THE AGE OF 18.

AN EXAMINATION OF BOOK BUYERS AND LIBRARY USERS. VERY FEW PEOPLE EITHER ONLY BUY THEIR BOOKS OR ONLY OBTAIN THEM FROM A LIBRARY AND MANY PEOPLE BUY BOOKS AS OFTEN AS THEY BORROW THEM. LIBRARY USERS WHO BORROW FEW BOOKS BUY A LARGER PROPORTION OF THEIR BOOKS THAN LIBRARY USERS WHO BORROW MANY BOOKS.
